# User Directory

For this project, I aim to create Google Books with React. This is an application created using MERN stack. It allows users to search for books via the Google Books API. The search results will be dynamically rendered in the UI and users will have the option to save and/or delete books. My main motivation for this project is to create an application that will allow users to manage their Google Boks search and have the ability to save and/or delete books.  

# User Story

<!-- As a user, I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once so that I have quick access to their information. -->

# Business Context

<!-- An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. It would be particularly helpful to be able to filter employees by name. -->

# Acceptance Criteria

<!-- Given a table of random users generated from the [Random User API](https://randomuser.me/), when the user loads the page, a table of employees should render. 

The user should be able to:
    * Sort the table by at least one category.
    * Filter the users by at least one property. -->
